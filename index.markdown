I'm Will Morris, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I research topics at the intersection of programming languages and HPC. Specifically, I design numeric abstract interpreters that leverage advancements in modern high-performance computer systems to bound the behavior of large partial differential equation solvers. 

I am advised by [Dr. Jacob Laurel](https://jsl1994.github.io/) at GaTech. Previously, I worked on model checking with [Dr. Eunsuk Kang's](https://eskang.github.io/) [SoDA](https://cmu-soda.github.io/) lab at Carnegie Mellon University, and on the [Twoville](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/3606402.3606411) programming language with [Dr. Chris Johnson](https://twodee.org/) at James Madison University.
